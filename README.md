# Hi, I'm Anne
I'm a 4th year CS student at the University of Waterloo. I'll be graduating in June of 2023! I've previously worked at Instagram, Salesforce, Wish and Heymarket, and this fall I'll be in NYC interning at Robinhood on the web3 team. 

I'm also a project lead/developer for [UW Blueprint](https://uwblueprint.org/) where my team is building a camp registration platform for Focus on Nature, a non-profit which hosts youth nature camps.
